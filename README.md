# Neural-Image-Synthesis

This Is a [KERAS](https://keras.io/) implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge.

Research experiment to Improve the brush strokes in Neural style Transfer and give user an option to choose Global brush stroke size control method.


An Illustration can be seen in the Image:

Image was taken from the paper: **Neural Style Transfer: A Review**

I am trying to Bring ideas from Non-photorealistic Rendering (NPR) field into Neural Image Transfer.Some of the papers presenting the idea are:-
> E. Zhang, J. Hays, and G. Turk. Interactive tensor field de- sign and visualization on surfaces
> E. Zhang, K. Mischaikow, and G. Turk. Vector field design on surfaces.
